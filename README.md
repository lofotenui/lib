## Work in Progress

This project is still in its early stages and is not ready for production use. As such, there is no installable package yet. If you want to try it out, you can clone the repo and run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Description

LofotenUI is a [Nord](https://nordtheme.com)-inspired [React](https://react.dev) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) component library for building rich web applications.
